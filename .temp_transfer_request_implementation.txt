I need to update the _create_transfer_request method in both CreateView and UpdateView to handle transfer_type and selected_operations. The method should:

1. Accept transfer_type and selected_operations as parameters
2. Use the same logic as TransferToLineCreateView.form_valid
3. Handle 'full' and 'operations' transfer types

Since the file is very large, I'll need to do targeted replacements.
